# employee-directory

## Description

Employee Directory is a front-end application built with React.js. The interface of the application is fairly simple. It has a Bootstrap Jumbatron at the top showing the name of the application. It also contains a Bootstrap table at the bottom of the page. And right in the middle it has a button to sort the data in the table by the first name and an input box to search the table by first name. The data in the table is pulled from the random user API. The first name, last name, country, and age are the four pieces of information extracted from each item in the array of objects. The API call requests ten random users with each call. Below is a picture of the landing page for the application.
